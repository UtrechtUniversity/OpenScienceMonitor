```{r, message=FALSE}

```


## Reading In the data

First specify the file path.

```{r, echo = T}
# filtered dataset
file <- "~/surfdrive/Shared/OS Monitor 2022/Data/Data/UOS OBP_ Open Science Monitor 2022.sav"
data_full<- read.spss(file, to.data.frame = TRUE) # read in the data
```

We will only analyze those that gave consent, have not retired yet, and are part of scientific staff. In addition, we will only assess respondents that have a maximum of 50% (6) missings on questions on awareness. First, we will compute a variable that represents this, and then we will filter out respondents. We assign this to a new object 'dat' which we will perform our analyses on.

```{r}
# select columns to use
data_raw <- data_full[, vars_OBP]
# filter out people
dat_withoutID <- data_raw %>%
  filter(Data_consent == 1) %>%
  mutate(missing_awareness = apply(.[,46:57], 1, function(x) x %>% is.na() %>% sum())) %>% # compute number of missings
  filter(missing_awareness <= 6) %>% # filter out persons with >6 missings
  select(-missing_awareness) # remove missingness variable

# create ID column
ID <- 1:nrow(dat_withoutID)
dat <- cbind(ID, dat_withoutID)

# create new variable indicating Faculty vs UBD/UB and variable indicating research
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(Fac_new = case_when(as.numeric(Fac_2) <= 8 | as.numeric(Fac_2) == 12 ~ "Faculty",
                            as.numeric(Fac_2) == 9 | as.numeric(Fac_2) == 10 ~ "UBD/UB",
                             TRUE ~ NA) %>% factor(),
         research = case_when(as.numeric(QTimeSpent_Res) >= 2 & as.numeric(QTimeSpent_Res) <= 6 ~ "Involved in Research",
                              as.numeric(QTimeSpent_Res) == 1 ~ "Not involved in Research",
                              TRUE ~ NA))
```
