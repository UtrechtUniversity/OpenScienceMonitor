## Reading In the data

We will only analyze those that gave consent, have not retired yet, and are part of scientific staff. In addition, we will only assess respondents that have a maximum of 50% (6) missings on questions on awareness. First, we will compute a variable that represents this, and then we will filter out respondents. We assign this to a new object 'dat' which we will perform our analyses on.

```{r}
# select columns to use
data_raw <- data_full[, vars_OBP]
# filter out people
dat_withoutID <- data_raw %>%
  filter(Data_consent == 1) %>%
  mutate(missing_awareness = apply(.[,46:57], 1, function(x) x %>% is.na() %>% sum())) %>% # compute number of missings
  filter(missing_awareness <= 6) %>% # filter out persons with >6 missings
  select(-missing_awareness) # remove missingness variable

# create ID column
ID <- 1:nrow(dat_withoutID)
dat <- cbind(ID, dat_withoutID)
```

## Get some basic descriptives

```{r}
# create descriptives for some variables
map(dat[,c("OSCU", "Gen", "Nationality", "Fac_2")], 
    table)
```
## Descriptives of Awareness {.tabset}

The code below prints the frequencies of awareness as tabs.

```{r, results='asis'}
# create list with tables
descr_aw <- dat %>% 
  select(Prac_Aw_1_1:Prac_Aw_1_12) %>%
  map(table)

# format tables
osm_descriptives(descr_aw, '###')
```

## Descriptives of Attitudes {.tabset}


```{r, results='asis'}
# create list with tables
descr_att <- dat %>%
  select(Prac_Att_1:Prac_Att_12) %>%
  map(table)

# format tables
osm_descriptives(descr_att, '###')
```

## Descriptives of Behaviors {.tabset}

The code below prints the frequencies of behaviors as tabs.

```{r, results='asis'}
# create list with tables
descr_beh <- dat %>%
  select(Prac_Beh_1:Prac_Beh_12) %>%
  map(table) %>%
  map(as.data.frame)

# format tables
osm_descriptives(descr_beh, '###')
```
