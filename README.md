Information and mock data repository for Utrecht University's Open Science Monitor.

## Background and pre-registration

This project was started by the Open Science Programme of Utrecht University. With the Open Science Monitor, the university aims to gain insight into what can be done to facilitate and support Open Science among academics at Utrecht University and University Medical Center Utrecht. The survey contains questions about awareness, attitudes and behaviors regarding several Open Science practices, as well as questions about the opportunities and barriers in carrying out those practices.

The pre-registration and report for the Open Science Monitor 2020 can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5725177">Zenodo</a> (pre-registration DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5727107; report DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5725178).

The pre-registration of the Open Science Monitor 2022 can be found on <a href="https://aspredicted.org/f5b9j.pdf">AsPredicted</a>.

## Analysis requests

The main analyses of the Open Science Monitor 2022 have been performed using SPSS (v.28). The corresponding syntax files can be found in the Analyses folder, see [the Contents section below](#contents).
 
If you would like to suggest secondary analyses for the Open Science Monitor 2022 data, please develop an analysis pipeline or syntax file that is compatible with the mock data in this repository. The mock data and codebooks can be found in the Data folder, see [the Contents section below](#contents). Preferably, use `R` or `SPSS` in these analysis requests.
